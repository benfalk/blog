I have been a *huge* Pink Floyd fan for most of my life, and I was pretty happy
to hear when the new album "Endless River" was coming out.  I decided to
pre-order my collectors copy a couple months ago and since it showed up on my
doorstep it has been playing non-stop.

Of course; nobody wants to keep their music just on CD.  You probably want it in
mp3 format for your portable player and so you can back it up to the _cloud_.
The program I found for ripping CDs is `asunder`.  If you are using
Ubuntu this should do the trick to get yourself ripping mp3s.

```
# Note, also installing "lame" for mp3 conversion
sudo apt-get install asunder lame
```

While I can't say this is my favorite album from Pink Floyd, it definitely
is up there with it's sister "Division Bell" from which most of the music was
recorded for as a second part.
