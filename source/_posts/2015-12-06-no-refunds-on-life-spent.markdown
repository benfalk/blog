Today after visiting my sick grandfather in the hospital I realised the time
spent in life offers no refunds.  Take the opportunities you have today to do
the things you really want to do.  I have _really_ been wanting to go back to
school and this hit home hard for me.  There is so much more I want to learn
and do with my life and the window I have to do it in is closing every day.
Sometimes we get complacent _"dancing for the man"_; staying comfortably
distracted by the workday.
