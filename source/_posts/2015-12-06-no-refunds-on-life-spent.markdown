After visiting my sick grandfather in the hospital I realised the time
spent in life offers no refunds.  Take the opportunities you have today for
the things you really want to do.  I have _really_ been wanting to go back to
school and this hit home hard for me.  There is so much more I want to learn
and do with my life and the window I have to do it in is closing every day.

Sometimes we get complacent _"dancing for the man"_; staying comfortably
distracted by the workday.  Don't let it happen!  Always challenge and audit
yourself to ensure you're spending the time you have on the investments which
are important to you.
