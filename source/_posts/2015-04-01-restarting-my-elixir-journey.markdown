Several years ago when I was still living in Austin I originally set out to
learn Elixir.  It's infancy back then was annoying to say the least for me so I
gave up on it at the time.  While waiting for 1.0 to sink in I've learned up on
Erlang, as that was one of the areas I felt I would need to know pretty solid
anyway if I wanted to get back into Elixir with any serious intent later.

Here are the books I want to knock out and get running with:

* [Programming Elixir: Functional |> Concurrent |> Pragmatic |> Fun](http://goo.gl/QhuVqH)
* [Metaprogramming Elixir: Write Less Code, Get More Done](http://goo.gl/tyuqBc)

I hope by the end of this month I'll have some serious headway so stay tuned for
posts on what I learn as I revisit this language I've lost touch with!
