Installing Erlang has been somewhat of a pain.  When trying to make sure I have
the version I want, relying on the ppa has not been that great.  Thankfully
someone has shared with me an amazing tool, [kerl](http://goo.gl/1Cb4Qd).

<!-- more -->

Somewhat like [rvm](http://goo.gl/xilOye) for Ruby, kerl keeps a list of the
Erlang versions you can build and has ways to switch between versions.  While
not as "feature complete" as rvm, this tool definitely fits the bill for me.
Trying to keep up with Erlang and learn the language is now a bit easier with
this _roadblock_ out of the way.
