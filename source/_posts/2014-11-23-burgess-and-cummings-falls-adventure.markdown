Went out to the Burgess and Cummings Falls state parks this weekend.  What an
amazing set of parks that are fairly close together.  Very excited to go back in
the summer for some in-water action!

## The Burgess Falls
Very well-kept trail that has a railing and steps for almost the entire trail.
I would like to go back when it's warmer and get close to the bottom set of
falls next summer.

## The Cummings Falls
Not only are these amazing to look at, but you can actually swim here as well!
