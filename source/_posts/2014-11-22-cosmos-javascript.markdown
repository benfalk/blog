If you've been following my blog you'll notice a spacy, cosmos background
with little stars floating about.  I saw this effect on another website and had
to replicate it for myself!  There isn't too much going on, but I did
enjoy building it.  For anyone curious about the source; here is a repo
created to help tool it out: [Cosmos](http://goo.gl/6hrrtn).
