A couple weeks back I lost my personal PC to a VR project that I've been wanting
to get setup for awhile now.  Without it I've been somewhat dead in the water so
I started looking for a PC replacement.  With my upcoming goals to get more into
game development there was a desire to get a beefier workstation.

After a fair chunk of research I've landed on getting a
[Thelio Mira from System76](https://system76.com/desktops/thelio-mira).  It
ships with a flavor of Ubuntu called "PopOS!" and it seems to be pretty darn
good.  This blog-post is the first thing I've done with the new machine but it
won't be the last :D.
