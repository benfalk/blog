I wanted to share this amazing tool I learned about called
[tig](http://goo.gl/fT6o3G).  Taken strait from the github repo page:

>Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. It functions mainly as a
>Git repository browser, but can also assist in staging changes for commit at
>chunk level and act as a pager for output from various Git commands.

What it doesn't mention is how amzing it is!  This nugget has kept me at the
command line longer these last couple days without needing to go go back
to a GUI like Github to get a clearer picture of a project landscape. I haven't
had enough time yet to fashion a good .tigrc file yet but looking at the man
page shows a ton of configurations for it.

It has quite a few modes.  Here is tig with no parameters in a git directory:

Here is tig blame on a file:
