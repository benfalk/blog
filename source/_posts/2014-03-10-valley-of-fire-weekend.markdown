Had an amazing time this weekend at the Valley of Fire.  For those of you who
have not been fortunate enough to visit, it is probably the coolest state parks
I have been at to date.

The park took up most of our Saturday; but that night we decided to head down
to Fremont Street for some dinner and drinks.

So, not much this weekend but relaxing and taking it easy =)
