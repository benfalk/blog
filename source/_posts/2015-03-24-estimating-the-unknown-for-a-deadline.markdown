One of the biggest "oh noes" in the book for me is when estimations are wanted
for work that already has a timeline and scope seemingly out of my control.  All
to often these kinds of projects _feel_ doomed to fail, or at best a gamble.
After reading a stream of different view points on this topic I decided to stop
and reflect on myself.  Why do I feel this way when a project takes this form?

<!-- more -->

The first thing I thought to myself is this _pattern_ has failed in the past;
however, that alone didn't feel like the true heart of the issue.  After digging
more into my thoughts I realized it's the feelings of defeat that accompany the
failure.  I have experienced plenty of defeating moments in the past, and none
of them ever seem to feel as terrible.  Why?

I believe it's because during these estimations you begin to convince yourself
into having a solution to resolve any disconnect between the scope and timeline
given. As work progresses and the solution you had in your mind begins to reveal
things you hadn't planned for you can start to feel trapped.  Shamed by missing
these holes in your plan you begin to work harder, and longer at getting done in
time. At the end, when and if the work misses it's deadline you're left believing
it was solely your own fault for not being able to make it happen.

I hope in the future to remember this and not become a victim of my own optimism.
