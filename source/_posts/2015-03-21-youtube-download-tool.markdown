I have been watching the [LCS](http://na.lolesports.com/) on my phone off and on
when I find some spare time and try to keep up on it during the week.  After
getting tired of sketching wifi spots and burning through my data plan I decided
to find a better way.

<!-- more -->

I found a really good tool called `youtube-dl` that can be installed with a
simple apt-get install on Ubuntu.  Now I can download each weekend's matches,
put them on my phone, and enjoy great un-interupted quality whenever!  I am
thinking of making a script to _sync_ a playlist with this; however, doing it
manually doesn't seem to painful yet.
