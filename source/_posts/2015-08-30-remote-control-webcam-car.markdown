I've been spending a lot of downtime thinking about how I can stay in better
contact now that I'm working remotely.  I have a whole basement to work out of
so I've decided to start looking into making my own wifi enabled, remote
control vehicle.  My goal is to have a working prototype by mid December, and I
want to use my blog to document how it's going.  What I would like to
accomplish is a car that you can view through and control remotely via
a web-site.  Some of my _"stretch goals"_ would be to have a rechargeable
docking station, the ability to move the webcam independently of the car, and a
small two-way display screen that can be activated.
