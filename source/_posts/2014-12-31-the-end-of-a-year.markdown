As the year ends I look back at the places I've been in the last year or so and
stand in awe at it all.  Learning new programming languages and living in new
locations make for a great combination!  All of the changes have left me a bit
out of shape though...

<!-- more -->

I noticed tonight, of all nights, that my favorite dress shirt doesn't quite fit
like it did this time last year.  Talk about a buzz kill...  I suspect I'll be
bringing in the new year with a resolution to drop off probably about forty or
so pounds.

I've done it before and I know I can do it again.  Back to eating how I used to
and tossing in a good about of exercise.  It seems like a gimic, but who would
guess that diet and exercise can yield such results?  In the coming days I want
to begin documenting my _size_ and everything I am doing to get it where it
needs to be.

It may be a tad early but *Happy New Year* !
