I've been pushing hard on learning Erlang for about four months now, and this
week felt like a good time to give a talk on what I've learned so far.  To aid
in my learning back in December I started developing
[Gridlock](http://goo.gl/02ipvw), a multi-player minesweeper clone that I've
built in the past with Node and Rails.

All in all it went really well and I am excited and ready to dive into
learning Elixir next.  I have enjoyed learning functional programming languages
and think there is some really good lessons to learn from them.  I'm not sure
what will be on my horizon next; however, I feel more confident having added
this knowledge to my tool belt!
