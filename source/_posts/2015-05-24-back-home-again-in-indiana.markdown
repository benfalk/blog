Coming back up to the homestead this Memorial Day weekend has been an amazing
and relaxing experience.  I've been chilling outside and enjoying the fresh air
while contemplating about moving back into a more rural setting myself.  My wife
and I have been talking about where to move next; and I hope it is somewhere a
little further away from the city!
