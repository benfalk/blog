Did this with a open source program called Flowblade.  Had some goof-ups with the
audio but other than that I was happy with how much it can do for being free.
The GoPro has been an awesome addition for collecting memories like this!

I hope in the future to get better at using Flowblade, one of the big things
that has been annoying me is I couldn't figure out what the shortcut key is for
cutting up portions of videos.  It feels like there should be a help menu
somewhere to help discover that but so far it has eluded me if it does exist.

A special thanks to Brad Potterbaum for helping me fumble my way through this!
