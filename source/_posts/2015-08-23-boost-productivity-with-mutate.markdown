After watching some of my fellow comrades on OSX use Alfred I simply had to get
this into my toolkit.  I have added a fantastic Linux clone named Mutate to my
standard install and have begun writing in custom macros to help boost my
productivity.  If you want to take a peek at the scripts I've been writing to
get ideas I've been adding them in [under my dotfiles.](https://github.com/benfalk/dotfiles/tree/master/config/Mutate)
