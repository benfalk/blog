Today was my last day in Tennessee as a resident!  I've made the exodus back to
Indiana to be closer to the family and take a break from the rest of the world.
It's amazing how refreshing it is to be writing this post on the farm with no
worry about driving back in a couple days.  This change of pace is exactly what
I've been looking for and I intend to make it count.
