One of the struggles that I hear time and time again is the one of management
that wants software produced at an overly fast pace.  I can of course sympathize
with this; however, when the quality of a developer's work is sacrificed in the
name of _speed_ things start to get tense.  The outlook on any software project
under these tensions normally begin to turn negative.

Often development teams begin to loose the feeling of autonomy when it feels
like management is asking for them to go below this level of quality that they
are comfortable with.  As this drops so does their motivation, which in turn
often effects their speed.  Potentially at some point a development team can
then start producing poorer quality code at slower speeds.  This is the exact
opposite of what management hopefully wanted!

As developers it is important to understand sometimes quality can't be as
perfect as some of us want it.  At the same time we shouldn't abandon our
sense of passion for building quality products.
