I have really been terrible at keeping up on this blog.  Never really quite
recovered from Christmas to get back into the swing of things.  Any excuse I
muster is really nothing more than that, an excuse.

So what have I been up to?  To hit the highlights, the wife and I went to Utah
for Valentines day and stayed at a rental house on a ranch.  It was an amazing
time!

It truely was a much needed escape from the long hours the team and I have been
putting into Fluencr for it's Febuary 1st launch.  Which is what I did most of
January.

I have also started making the move to programming in the terminal with Vim
instead of desktop related GUI ide tools.  Not being a normal user of Vim it
was rough going there for awhile but I am finally starting to get a good grasp
of it.  Hopefully in the next couple months I'll be a fully fledged text 
shredding master with Vim!

Probably the last big item I have been working on is learning Erlang.  Having
dinked around with Elixir about eight months ago it had me very interested.
With some of the concurrent requirements we are having at work it seems like a 
good idea to try leveraging some of the power Erlang and it's ruby like cousin
Elixir bring to the table.

It may be a bit dated, but [here is the presentation](http://goo.gl/z16zOf) I
did on Elixir back then if you are interested.

I really hope to get back on my google analytics tool I started on... shame on
me for just doing nothing with it lately.

Until next time!
