The last week or so has been a challenging time for me.  The one thing I've
always been able to rely on is my wife Cassandra.  She is there supporting me
when the world feels like too much to take on.  I feel incredibly lucky to have
her by my side; doing her best to keep patient during my moments of absent
minded blundering.
