This week at work we were faced with one of those pre-launch fires.  Stakes were
high and emotions where even higher.  Nothing feels worse in the work place then
the pressure of tackling something like lost data or an uncontrollable outage.
Needless to say, after long hours and several dead ends we were able to triage
the problem and prevent a launch disaster.  Looking back at it now, several days
later, it reminded me of the time our barn caught fire growing up.

I can still remember driving home from town with my mom.  We saw smoke in the
distance and the closer we got to home the bigger the smoke clouds got.  When we
finally got into view of our farm it was a sickening feeling, watching smoke
belch out from all sides.  Mom slammed on the gas and we raced down the last
stretches of rural stone roads.  When we got there mom shouted for us to make
sure all of the animals were out and to get the hoses ready as she ran to the
house to call the fire department.

Luckily for us, we lived around some great neighbors and one of them had already
called the fire department and was in our barn already throwing buckets of water
on hay that had spontaneously combusted.  I brought up the garden hoses for him
and we had most of fire contained when the fire department arrived.  In the end
thankfully the only thing destroyed was hay and some minor damage to the
barn.  Probably the longest part of the whole ordeal was the with the fire
department after the fire.  They spent several hours studying what had happened
and helped us make sure it wouldn't happen again.

Putting out our "fire" at work was a fourteen hour process, much longer then
the incident with the barn.  The time spent afterward understanding what
happened and why though has taken several days. There is a huge importance in
finding these causing factors and learning from them. It's all to easy to put
the fire out and go back to work as normal.  Never let a crisis go to waste,
take the opportunity to learn from it.
