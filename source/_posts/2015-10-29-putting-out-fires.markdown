When your house is on fire, I'm pretty sure the first thing you **don't** do is
try to figure out what started it.  If I were to stab a guess, the first thing
you'd want to do is make sure the things you care about the most are safe.
Following that, your next primary concern is probably putting out the fire!  I
would like to explore some parallels to a real fire and the mission critical
problems we sometimes have in production.
