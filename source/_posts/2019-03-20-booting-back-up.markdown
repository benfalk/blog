Wow, it's been a minute.  I had to do a little bit of reading and fiddling to
even make sure I still knew how to update my own blog :\ .  What's up with my
absence?  I guess there isn't really a good reason for it, just fell out of a
practice and it's a shame that it happened.

I've spent that last couple of years growing my Elixir craft as well as picking
up on dotnet-core; however, I don't think I'm where I should be in my growth.
After really taking stock of my life both professionally and personally I'm not
where I thought I'd be.  Blogging is really a big part of that and it's for that
reason I'm picking it back up.  There is so much I could be and will be talking
about.

So... what am I really saying?  I've taken stock of my life recently and am ready
to make some changes in it; and blogging again is one of them.  For a starting
goal I'll try to post at **least** twice a week.  Hopefully as time goes on it
will pick up more consistently.
