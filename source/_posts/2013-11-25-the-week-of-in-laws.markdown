The start of my weekend was spent helping prepare our house for the coming of
my in-laws.  The wife and I super cleaned everything and put the finishing
touches on the guest bedroom.  They showed up Sunday in the afternoon with
their two dogs and so far no problems to report.  Our goal now is to pack each
day with activities to keep us all occupied.

It was raining for about three days strait here in Vegas and I think it finally
took it's toll on our internet as it went out and didn't come back until
sometime Sunday morning.  It is crazy how we have so little to do in the
house when the internet is down... it may be time to find some alternative
forms of entertainment and hobbies.

On a different front, I finally started playing some of BioShock Infinite.  So
far I like it, but not as much as the original BioShock.  I liked the dark
creepy feeling that was ever constant in the first one and the epic Big Daddy
fights that happened.  Infinite one doesn't seem to have as much of those in it.
Having said that, the story line is pretty awesome so far and having a 
companion following you around that is part of the story line is pretty cool as
well.
