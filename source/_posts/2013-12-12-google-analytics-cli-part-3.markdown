Finished up the research on how to authenticate with Google for limited input
devices.  For reference that information is found [here](http://goo.gl/iZM0FC).
I have been designing out a flow for the application to detect if it needs an
authentication token and alert the user through the standard error with
directions on what to do to and then begins checking for the user's approval.

I haven't make to much progress, but I am happy with what I have accomplished
so far =)
