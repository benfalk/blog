When the weight of the world really seems to squeeze in it becomes more
important to disconnect from what "seems" important.  Step back and take a few
moments to enjoy what is around you!  I was able to capture this photo with
Cassandra while we walked around the Harlinsdale Farm.  It helps me remember
work isn't supposed to be as involved and important as I make it sometimes...
